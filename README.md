# Linear Equation Solver 3x3

Console based application that solves 3x3 linear equation systems for you. It uses Cramer's and Sarrus's methods and gives you the result for each determinant and the solutions for the 3 unknown variables in the system.

## Release notes: 
* Gives you the value for each determinant
* Gives you the value for each solution (x y z)

## Compilation requirements
* It should compile with almost every C++ compiler
* I am using Code::Blocks and GCC currently.
